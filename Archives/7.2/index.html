<h1><b>Soar Version 7.2 Release</b></h1>
<p>
This is the working page for the Soar 7.2 Release(9/1/98).   <!a HREF="Soar72.RelNotes">Release
Notes</a> are under construction and will be available shortly. Soar
7.2 requires Tcl7.6 and Tk4.2 on all systems (Mac, Windows and Unix).
If you are already running Eaters, TankSoar, or the AAAI-97 version
of Soar (Soar 7.1), you already have Tcl7.6 and Tk4.2. If you are upgrading
from Soar 7.0.*, or don't have Soar at all yet, you will have to check
to see if you have Tcl, and if so, what version you have. Soar 7.2
is also compatible with Tcl 8.0, but it does requires that you rebuild
Soar, linking with Tcl/Tk8.0.  The binaries provided below were built
for Tcl 7.6/Tk4.2.  The README.(systype) files in the distribution
will tell you how to check for Tcl on your system, and what to do if
you don't have it.

<h1>Soar 7.2 for Windows</h1>
<li><a HREF="Soar72.EXE"><strong>Soar72.EXE</strong></a>.
(2.7 Mb) The self-installing binaries for Windows 95 / Windows NT (and
possibly even Windows 3.1 with Win32s installed, but we haven't tested
that). 
<p>
The standard installation location for Tcl/Tk on Windows is in "C:\Program
Files\TCL" If you don't see Tcl there, first do a File Find on your
system to see if someone installed Tcl somewhere else. If you don't
have Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 already installed on your system, grab the <a HREF="http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/7.6.html"><strong>Windows
3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT self-extracting installer (tcl7_6/win76p2.exe)</strong></a>:
(about 1.5 Mbytes) The file is a self-extracting executable. It will
install the Tcl and Tk libraries, the <code>wish</code> and <code>tclsh</code>
programs, and documentation. 
<p>
THEN, because we think these Tcl/Tk binaries are slightly buggy, we
recommend that you apply the following <strong> <a HREF="win32-tcltk-patch.zip">
patches</strong></a>. that Chris Waterson developed, using the <a HREF="README.win32-tcltk-patch">README</a>
file he wrote. This should clear up any segfaults that appear on some
systems when exiting Soar. If Tcl/Tk was previously installed on your
system and you get the seg faults when you exit Soar, you should install
the patches. If you choose not to install these patches, you will probably
get warning messages from the Windows operating system whenever you
exit Soar. They are usually pretty harmless, although some people have
reported that they have occasionally had to reboot after these errors.

<p>
If at all possible, use the defaults for file locations and installation
settings. Soar-7.2 will require no reconfiguration for your Windows
system if you have installed Tcl/Tk on the C: drive (specifically in
"C:\Program Files\TCL", and if Soar is unzipped to c:\ (it will default
to a folder called Soar-7.2). Just open the Soar-7.2 folder and dbl-click
on the Soar icon (a feather, for now) to start Soar. If you need to
use locations other than the defaults, or if you aren't able to run
Soar by dbl-clicking on the Soar icon, see the <a href="README.Win">README.Win</a>
file for information about what you will need to change to run Soar.

<h1>Soar 7.2 for Macintosh </h1>
<li><a HREF="Soar72.sea.hqx"><strong>Soar72.sea.hqx</strong></a>.
(6.9 Mb) A BinHex 4.0 self-extracting archive that includes the binary
distributions for Power PC Macs. This archive also includes the Tcl/Tk
Installer for installing Tcl7.6/Tk4.2. (If you already have this version
of Tcl/Tk installed, you can just dump the Installer program in the
trash.) Download and extract the Soar archive file (by dbl-clicking
on the Soar-72.sea icon), which will create a folder called Soar-7.2.
See the <a href="README.Macintosh">README.Macintosh</a> file to
get started. 
<hr>

<h1>Soar 7.2 for Unix </h1>
<li><a HREF="Soar72.tgz"><strong>Soar72.tgz</strong></a>.
(2.1 Mb) A gnu-zipped tar file which includes the precompiled libraries
for Linux. See the <a href="README.Unix">README.Unix</a> file for
information on running Soar and on building Soar for other Unix systems.
If there is enough demand, we can possibly build and post libraries
for SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 5.5.1, Linux 2.0.30, and IRIX 5.3. If you
need to install Tcl7.6 and Tk4.2, you can obtain the code and follow
the instructions found on the <a HREF="http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/7.6.html"><strong>Scriptics
Tcl7.6 Download Page</strong></a>. About a third of the way down that
page you'll find the info for Unix sources.
