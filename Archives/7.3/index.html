<h1><b>Soar Version 7.3 Release</b></h1>
<p>
This is the working page for the Soar 7.3 Release. <a HREF="Soar73.RelNotes">Release
Notes</a> are under construction and will be available shortly. 
<p>
This is the last supported release of Soar 7.  Soar 8 is also now available
and the first few releases of Soar 8 will include a compatibility mode
that allows users to run using the Soar 7 methodology.  Eventually
we expect all users to migrate to the Soar 8 architecture, and the
Soar 7 compatibility will be removed from the kernel.  
See the <!a HREF="Soar73.RelNotes">Soar 7.3 Release Notes</a> for information on the differences between Soar
7 and Soar 8.
<p>
Soar 7.3 requires that Tcl and Tk be installed on unix and Windows systems.
The Mac version has Tcl included and does not require a specific
installation process for Tcl.   <b>It is recommended that users install <a HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/software/8.0.html">Tcl/Tk
8.0</a>.</b>  <b>The pre-built binaries below require Tcl 8.0.</b>  If you are
upgrading from Soar 7.0.*, or don't have Soar at all yet, you will
have to check to see if you have Tcl, and if so, what version you have.
 If you are upgrading from Soar 7.1 or Soar 7.2, then you already have
Tcl 7.6 and Tk 4.2 installed.  Soar 7.3 is also compatible with Tcl
7.6 and Tk 4.2, but it may require that you rebuild Soar, linking
with Tcl7.6/Tk4.2. The binaries provided below were built for Tcl/Tk8.0.
The Linux binary will work under either Tcl 8.0 or Tcl 7.6, but I 
don't think the Windows and Mac binaries are compatible with Tcl 7.6.
The README.(systype) files in the distribution will tell you how to
check for Tcl on your system, and what to do if you don't have it.

<h1>Soar 7.3 for Windows</h1>
<li><a HREF="Soar73.EXE"><strong>Soar73.EXE</strong></a>.
(1.8 Mb) The self-installing binaries for Windows 95 / 98/Windows NT
<p>
The standard installation location for Tcl/Tk on Windows is in "C:\Program
Files\TCL" If you don't see Tcl there, first do a File Find on your
system to see if someone installed Tcl somewhere else. If you don't
have Tcl8.0 already installed on your system, grab the <a HREF="ftp://ftp.scriptics.com/pub/tcl/tcl8_0/tcl804.exe"><strong>Windows
95, and Windows NT self-extracting installer (tcl804.exe)</strong></a>:
(about 1.75Mbytes) The file is a self-extracting executable. It will
install the Tcl and Tk libraries, the <code>wish</code> and <code>tclsh</code>
programs, and documentation. 
<p>
If at all possible, use the defaults for file locations and installation
settings. Soar-7.3 will require no reconfiguration for your Windows
system if you have installed Tcl/Tk on the C: drive (specifically in
"C:\Program Files\TCL"), and if Soar is unzipped to c:\ (it will default
to a folder called Soar-7.3). Just open the Soar-7.3 folder and dbl-click
on the Soar icon (a feather, for now) to start Soar. You my have to
first edit the "properties" of the Soar shortcut to make sure the pathname
of the executable is valid for your machine.  If you need to use locations
other than the defaults, or if you aren't able to run Soar by dbl-clicking
on the Soar icon, see the <a HREF="README73.Win">README.Win</a>
file for information about what you will need to change to run Soar.

<h1>Soar 7.3 for Unix </h1>
<li><a href="Soar73.tgz"><strong>Soar73.tgz</strong></a>.
(1.1 Mb) A gnu-zipped tar file which includes the precompiled libraries
for Linux. 
<p>
See the <a HREF="README73.Unix">README.Unix</a> file
for information on running Soar and on building Soar for other Unix
systems. If there is enough demand, we can possibly build and post
libraries for SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 5.5.1, Linux 2.0.30, and IRIX 5.3.
If you need to install Tcl8.0, you can obtain the code and follow the
instructions found on the <a HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/software/8.0.html"><strong>Scriptics
Tcl 8.0 Download Page</strong></a>. About a third of the way down that
page you'll find the info for Unix sources.

<h1>Soar 7.3 for Macintosh </h1>
<strong> The combination of upgrading to Code Warrior Pro 3 and to Tcl 8.0.4
was causing fits for building Soar-7.3 on the Mac.  Everything compiled just
fine, but the linker could not find the standard library functions, eventhough
the libraries are specified in the build instructions.  So for the Macintosh, 
Soar 7.3 was built with Tcl 7.6 / Tk 4.2.  No Soar functionality is lost,
but users will not benefit from the improvements to Tcl on the Mac platform.
</strong>
<p> 
<li><a HREF="Soar73.sea.hqx"><strong>Soar73.sea.hqx</strong></a>.
(5.7 Mb) A BinHex 4.0 self-extracting archive that includes the binary
distributions for Power PC Macs. This archive also includes the Tcl/Tk
Installer for installing Tcl7.6/Tk4.2. (If you already have this version
of Tcl/Tk installed, you can just dump the Installer program in the
trash.) 
<p>

Download and extract the Soar archive file (by dbl-clicking on the
Soar-73.sea icon), which will create a folder called Soar-7.3.  If you
don't have Tcl 7.6 already installed, dbl-click on the Tcl/Tk Installer.
Then click on the "SoarMac" icon to start Soar with the full TSI, or click on
"SoarTutorial" to create a single soar agent and hide the Control Panel
and console windows.  See the <a HREF="README73.Macintosh">README.Macintosh</a>
file for a few more details on how to get started. 
<p>
 This Mac distribution was modified
specifically for CogSci 99, to update the analogy demos,  and automatically
create a single Soar agent for the tutorial.
