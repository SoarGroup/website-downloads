<h1>Soar 8.6.4 Beta</h1>

<p>Note: this is not a full release of Soar and is not intended for wide distribution.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>Right click and save: <a href="SoarSuite-8.6.4-beta-win32.zip">SoarSuite-8.6.4-beta-win32.zip</a></p>

<p>Unzip to a folder of your choice. Note: the demos have some long
filenames and this may cause an error during extraction, it is safe to
ignore this error. To avoid this error, extract to C:\ or C:\Soar</p>

<p>Use the included batch files (run-Debugger, run-VisualSoar, run-TankSoar, run-Eaters) to launch Soar.</p>

<p>Sun Java version 5 (1.5) or newer is required if you don't have it already: <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a></p>
<p>To see what version of Java you have installed, run Start Menu / Run / cmd and type: </p>
<pre>java -version</pre>

<p>If you have a newer version installed than what is being reported by that command, try uninstalling previous versions.</p>

<h3>Mac OS X Intel Platform</h3>

<p>Save and extract to your desktop: <a href="SoarSuite-8.6.4-beta-osx.tgz">SoarSuite-8.6.4-beta-osx.tgz</a></p>

<p>Start a terminal and change to the folder you just extracted, usually: </p>
<pre>cd Desktop/SoarSuite-8.6.4-beta-osx</pre>
<br>
<p>Launch Soar by running the files in that folder inside the Terminal window, note the "./" prefix:</p>

<pre>./run-Debugger.sh<br>./run-TankSoar.sh<br>./run-Eaters.sh<br>./run-VisualSoar.sh</pre>


<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>Save and extract to a folder of your choice: <a href="SoarSuite-8.6.4-beta-linux.tgz">SoarSuite-8.6.4-beta-linux.tgz</a></p>

<p>Change to the folder you just extracted and run the scripts to launch Soar applications.</p>

<pre>./run-Debugger.sh<br>./run-TankSoar.sh<br>./run-Eaters.sh<br>./run-VisualSoar.sh</pre>

<p>Note: Sun Java 1.5 or better must be installed. These applications
are known to not work with other, non-Sun runtimes. Try them at your
own risk.</p>

<p>To upgrade Java, please consult your distribution documentation as
the procedure varies widely depending on what flavor of Linux you are
using.</p>
