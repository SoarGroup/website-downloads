		<P>Each year members of the Soar community--faculty, scientists, graduate students, 
			technical staff and developers--gather together for several days of intensive 
			interaction and exchange on Soar. The Soar community is widely distributed 
			geographically. These workshops provide the opportunity for having face-to-face 
			conversations, for hearing about the current status of other participants’ 
			research, and for looking forward to what will be happening in the future. We 
			will try to give as many members of the community as possible the opportunity 
			to describe their research or to discuss whatever Soar issues are of concern to 
			them. This means the time available per talk is quite short (typically either 5 
			or 15 minutes). Since workshop attendees are already well-entrenched in the 
			Soar world, however, brief talks that concentrate on only the essentials work 
			very well.
		</P>
		<P>The Soar Workshop is announced on the soar-group mailing list, but we do want to 
			ensure that everyone actively working with Soar does get invited. If you know 
			of anyone who really should have been invited, but did not receive an 
			announcement, please let us know. Proceedings from the previous Soar workshops 
			are available online:</P>
