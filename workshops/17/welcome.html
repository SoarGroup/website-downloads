<P>This site contains the schedule and most of the presentations from the
17th Soar Workshop, hosted by <A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/" 
TARGET="_top">The Department of Computer and Information Science</A> at
<A HREF="http://www.acs.ohio-state.edu/" TARGET="_top">The Ohio State University</A>.
There are also links to the home pages of  the workshop presenters.</P>

<P>The presentations are all in PDF format; to view them you should have
the Adobe Acrobat viewer, which you can download free for any platform.
The most convenient way to view most of the presentations is with the Acrobat
plug-in for your browser, so that you can view the slides directly in this
frame. The Acrobat download includes both the stand-alone viewer and the
plug-in, and is available here:</P>

</MAP><IMG SRC="get-acrobat.gif" WIDTH="88" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="BOTTOM" 
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" USEMAP="#get-acrobat" ISMAP BORDER="0"></P>

<P>Unfortunately, my experience has been that sometimes the Acrobat plug-in
cannot view something that the stand-alone reader can. If you have problems
viewing a presentation, you might try switching to the stand-alone reader.</P>

<P>The sidebar at left contains some links to the workshop schedule and
talks, and some other Soar-relevant sites; the &quot;Welcome Page&quot;
link will take you back to this page.</P>

<P>If there are corrections or additions (e.g., missing links) that should
be made to the site, please send mail to <A HREF="mailto:rick@cis.ohio-state.edu">rick@cis.ohio-state.edu.</A>.
I'll also collect comments on the web site and suggestions for improvements,
but these will be for the benefit of the next workshop!</P>
