<P>This site contains the schedule and most of the presentations from the
19th North American Soar Workshop, hosted by the&nbsp; <A HREF="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu">Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory</A> of <A HREF="http://www.umich.edu">The University
of Michigan</A> .

<P>The presentations are all in PDF format; to view them you should have
the Adobe Acrobat viewer, which you can download free for any platform.
The most convenient way to view most of the presentations is with the Acrobat
plug-in for your browser, so that you can view the slides directly in this
frame. The Acrobat download includes both the stand-alone viewer and the
plug-in, and is available here:

<P>Sometimes the Acrobat plug-in cannot view something that the stand-alone
reader can. If you have problems viewing a presentation, you might try
switching to the stand-alone reader.

<P>If there are corrections or additions (e.g., missing links) that should
be made to the site, please send mail to
